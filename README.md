# High-Risk-Bank-Customer-Detection
Detecting High Risk Bank Customers With Ensemble Models

In this project, I train, test, and evaluate an ensemble model using bank customer profiles to predict whether a customer is considered high risk. The dataset contains a class called "pep", in this case, a PEP is a politically exposed person and represents a high risk customer. The purpose of this analysis is to correctly identify a high risk customer from various attributes included in a customer profile. 

After cleaning and preparing the dataset, I evaluate a Decision Tree Model and a Random Forest Classifier model. Then, I try to improve the Decision Tree model accuracy by employing a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree model. Ultimately these approaches provided adequate models to predict whether a customer is high risk based on their profile attributes.
